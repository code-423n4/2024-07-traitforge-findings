1. If the forge() mints the last tokenId in the gen, next user could receive the tokenId in the gen+1 with the significant less price, which lead to the protocol money loose.
## Impact
- The problem here is that if the mintEntity will be minted exactly at the end of the generation, the next user could mint an NFT without paying a full price for it, only the base price.
Once the gen will be updated, the generationMintCounts will be set to 0.

After, the user will invoke the mintToken function and the price will be multiplied by 0, which will lead to more favorable price the user can buy a token https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-traitforge/blob/279b2887e3d38bc219a05d332cbcb0655b2dc644/contracts/TraitForgeNft/TraitForgeNft.sol#L181
##Recommended Mitigation Steps
Ensure that the price for the first token minted will not be multiplied by 0


## Impact
2. no check in the _incrementGeneration that ensures there is only 10 gen.

## Impact
3. mintWithBudget doesnâ€™t ensure the msg.sender as payable

## Impact
4. During the forgeWithListed function , the excess fees is not refunded
